add a splash page on the right hand side
add, you know, the actual functionality of having a marker click refresh the right side with the corresponding blog entry

DONE
Add legend - older to newer
Tooltip - blog post title, date, location (?)
d3 color features by age
highlight selected entry in a different color
add previous/next functionality - by clicking the lines connecting to the selected point
    OK. I've added uinqueIDs to each marker.
    Let's first make sure we can fire clicks by uniqueID. DONE whew
    Then I think the plan is:
        Onclick of each marker, set a global variable activeID to = that marker's uniqueID
        Add "startID" and "endID" options to each geodesic line
        Onclick of each geodesic line, check if startID or endID matches the currently selected endID
        If so, fire a click on the marker with uniqueID corresponding to the other end
    Yes, this worked!
